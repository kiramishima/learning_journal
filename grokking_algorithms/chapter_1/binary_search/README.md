# Note
Binary search only works when your list is in sorted order. For example, the names in a phone book are sorted in alphabetical order, so you can
use binary search to look for a name. What would happen if the names
weren’t sorted?


# Exercises


## Suppose you have a sorted list of 128 names, and you’re searching through it using binary search. What’s the maximum number of steps it would take?

$ log_2{128} = 7$

R= 7 steps

## Suppose you double the size of the list. What’s the maximum number of steps now

$ log_2{256} = 8$

R= 8 steps
